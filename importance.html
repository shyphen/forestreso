          <h1>WHY DO WE NEED FOREST RESOURCES?</h1>
          <br>
          <p><b>"Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our 
            people."</b> <br> - Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>"The forest is not merely an expression or representation of sacredness, nor a place to 
            invoke the sacred; the forest is sacredness itself."</b> <br> - Richard Nelson</p>
          <br>
           <p><b>"The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn
             over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value."</b> <br> - Theodore Roosevelt</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>Forest resources are crucial components of the Earth's ecosystem, playing a vital role in maintaining 
            ecological balance and sustaining life on our planet. One of the primary significance of forest 
            resources lies in their contribution to the regulation of the global climate. Forests act as carbon 
            sinks, absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and thereby helping to mitigate 
            the impacts of climate change. Additionally, they release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis,
            which is essential for the survival of all living organisms, including humans.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Moreover, forest resources provide habitat and shelter for a diverse array of plant and animal species,
            many of which are endemic and endangered. These ecosystems support biodiversity, fostering genetic 
            variation and resilience against environmental stresses. Forests also offer numerous ecosystem services,
            such as soil conservation, water filtration, and pollination, which are vital for agricultural 
            productivity, water quality, and human well-being. Furthermore, forests play a crucial role in 
            sustaining indigenous cultures and traditional knowledge, serving as sources of food, medicine, and 
            spiritual connection for countless communities around the world.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In addition to their ecological significance, forest resources also have immense economic importance. 
          They serve as sources of timber, fuelwood, and various non-timber forest products that contribute to 
          local livelihoods and national economies. Moreover, forests attract tourism and recreational activities, 
          generating revenue and employment opportunities for communities residing in forested areas. Sustainable 
          management and conservation of forest resources are therefore essential not only for preserving the 
          environment and biodiversity but also for promoting socio-economic development and ensuring the well-being
          of present and future generations.</p>

          <p><b>"What we are doing to the forests of the world is but a mirror reflection of what we are doing to 
            ourselves and to one another."</b> <br> - Mahatma Gandhi</p>
